 Different specs to look into while buying a PC or laptop </h2>
<h3 style="font-size:25px;font-family:courier;color:red;">1. <b>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory" target="_blank" title="Go to RAM wiki page"> RAM </a></b>- 
This type of memory is volatile and while selecting a PC or lap select one with atleast 4GB. An 8GB is really good.
(If possible look for which has an option of upgradation of RAM ) </h3>
<h3 style="font-size:25px;font-family:courier;color:red;">2. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory" target="_blank" title="Go to ROM Wiki page">ROM </a> - 
Two types are available, they are HDD and SSD. THe advantage of SSD is that it is way more 
faster than HDD and shows a very good performence but it is a little expensive. If you want 
to have a bigger storage capacity then you can choose HDD </h3>
<h3 style="font-size:25px;font-family:courier;color:red;">3. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit" target="_blank" target="Got to CPU Wiki page"> CPU </a> - 
A central processing unit (CPU) is an important part of every computer. 
The CPU sends signals to control the other parts of the computer, almost like how a brain 
controls a body. The CPU is an electronic machine that works on a list of computer things 
to do, called instructions. The two leading Processor manufacters are Intel and AMD. 
Intel is a bit expensive but good performence. AMD is good compared to the price range if 
INTEL. </h3>
<h3 style="font-size:25px;font-family:courier;color:red;">4. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit" target="_blank" title="Go to GPU Wiki page"> GPU </a> - 
This one is optional and can very much affect the price of lap. A graphics card, 
also called a video card or a display card, is a circuit board in a computer with 
specialized hardware optimized for displaying high-quality graphics at a high rate of speed. Most modern computers include them, 
and while they're sometimes associated with video gamers looking to get the most fun out of their games, they're also useful 
for professional applications like using Adobe Photoshop to edit photos or editing business videos. </h3>
<h3 style="font-size:25px;font-family:courier;color:red;">5. 
<a href="https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/556585/top-10-things-consider-when-buying-new-laptop/" target="_blank"> Quality </a>
 - Try to buy a laptop of well known company like HP, Dell, Apple ,Asus ,Acer ,Lenovo ,etc. And also look for good options 
in an official store rather than purchasing online. This reduces the risk factor in software glitches and similar small errors </h3>
<h3 style="font-size:25px;font-family:courier;color:red;">
6. Other miscallaneous factors like WiFi speed, USB, Ethernet ports, Screen quality, 
Build quality, battery life, keyboard quality, size and form factor </h3>

Different Operating Systems(OS) to consider while selecting a lap and their uses and 
features </h2>
<h3 style="font-size:25px;font-family:courier;color:red;"> 
<u>Basically there are three different OS commonly used</u><br><br><br>
1.<b><u><q>MacOS</q></u></b> by Apple <br>
<img src="C:\Users\Amaresh\Documents\HTML\Trial_Assign1_Pic&Vid\MACOS-LOGO.jpg" alt="Image of MacOS" width=200px height=150px></img> <br>
One of the best OS for general purpose uses and also for heavy graphical uses and it also 
have a lot of in-built features in them, but the con is it is very expensive <br><br><br><br>
2.<b><u><q>Windows</q></u></b> by MicroSoft <br>
<img src="C:\Users\Amaresh\Documents\HTML\Trial_Assign1_Pic&Vid\Windows_Logo.jpg" alt="Image of Windows OS" width=200px height=150px></img><br>
It is one of the most commonly used OS in the world and default OS due to its popular 
application softwares like MSWord,MSOffice,etc. License for this OS also a bit expensive but is covered when you buy the laptop. 
It is the the most vulnerable OS which is prone to virus attack,therefore it requires an Antivirus Software <br><br><br><br>
3. <b><u><q>LINUX</q></u></b> based OS's. <br>
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel" target="_blank"> Click here </a> 
to know what is a KERNEL and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel" target="_blank">click here </a> to know about LINUX KERNEL. <br>
There are several linux based OS's and each have their on specific use.
 Some of the commonly used linux based OS,s are Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora , Debian, Kali Linux,etc<br><br><br><br>
3(a). <u>Ubuntu</u> <br>
<img src="C:\Users\Amaresh\Documents\HTML\Trial_Assign1_Pic&Vid\ubuntu_logo.jpg" alt="Image of Ubuntu OS" ></img> <br>
Ubuntu is general purpose everyday use OS base on linux kernel. it is free, 
open source unlike the closed source nature of windows thereby we can customize it according
 to our wish. It is one of the most secure OS and no need to install an additional antivirus
 software. is is the best OS for programmers.<br><br><br>
AS IT DOES NOT COME AS A DEFAULT OS WE HAVE TO INSTALL IT ADDITIONALLY,
THERE ARE TWO WAYS IN DOING THAT, 1. DUAL BOOT, 2. RUN UBUNTU ON A VIRTUAL MACHINE<br><br>
1. <u>Dual Boot</u>- We can give our to the shop and as them to set up dual boot in it. 
when we do so and switch on the system an option comes where we can select the required 
OS of our choice. One of the advantage is that we utilize the full hardware and software 
resource. But when you do the above make sure it your lap has a pretty powerful processor 
and minimum of 8GB of RAM otherwise the lap may becomes slow amd hang<br><br>
2. <u>Run Ubuntu on Virtual Machine</u>- First we have to install Virtual Machine and 
install ubuntu and run on it.<br> 
Detailed video of the above process is given 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5MhydijWmc" target="_blank"> here </a> <br><br><br>
3(b). <u>Linux Mint</u>- for general purpose and everyday use. 
One advantage is that is is very lightweight therefore can work on old lap. <br><br><br>
3(c). <u>Debian</u> - for general purpose and everyday use. <br><br><br>
4. <u>OpenBSD</u> - not commonly used but still a good one.<br><br><br>
<b>ALL OF THE ABOVE OS ARE INTALLED AND RUN SAME AS UBUNTU</b><br><br><br></h3>
